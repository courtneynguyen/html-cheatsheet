## HTML5 Tags

| Tag | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `<figure>` | represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (`<figcaption>`), and is typically referenced as a single unit. |
| `<figcaption>` | represents a caption or a legend associated with a figure or an illustration described by the rest of the data of the `<figure>` element which is its immediate ancestor. |
| `<dl>` | represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms and descriptions. Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs). |
| `<dd>` | indicates the description of a term in a description list (`<dl>`). |
| `<dt>` | identifies a term in a description list. This element can occur only as a child element of a `<dl>`. It is usually followed by a `<dd>` element; however, multiple `<dt>` elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next `<dd>` element. |
| `<main>` | represents the main content of  the `<body>` of a document or application. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to, or expands upon the central topic of a document or the central functionality of an application. |
| `<pre>` | represents preformatted text. Text within this element is typically displayed in a non-proportional ("monospace") font exactly as it is laid out in the file. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as typed. |
| `<template>` | mechanism for holding client-side content that is not to be rendered when a page is loaded but may subsequently be instantiated during runtime using JavaScript. |
| `<abbr>` | element represents an abbreviation and optionally provides a full description for it. If present, the title attribute must contain this full description and nothing else. |
| `<footer>` | element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents. |
| `<time>` | element represents either a time on a 24-hour clock or a precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information). |
| `<small>` | element makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large to medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum font size.  In HTML5, this element is repurposed to represent side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation. |
| `<em>` | element marks text that has stress emphasis. The `<em>` element can be nested, with each level of nesting indicating a greater degree of emphasis. |
| `<mark>` | element represents highlighted text, i.e., a run of text marked for reference purpose, due to its relevance in a particular context. For example it can be used in a page showing search results to highlight every instance of the searched-for word. |
| `<code>` | element represents a fragment of computer code. By default, it is displayed in the browser's default monospace font. |
| `<cite>` | element represents a reference to a creative work. It must include the title of a work or a URL reference, which may be in an abbreviated form according to the conventions used for the addition of citation metadata. |
| `<address>` | element supplies contact information for its nearest `<article>` or `<body>` ancestor; in the latter case, it applies to the whole document. |
| `<aside>` | element represents a section of a document with content connected tangentially to the main content of the document (often presented as a sidebar). |
| `<article>` | element represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry. |
| `<section>` |  element represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. |
| `<header>` | element represents a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, a search form, and so on. |
| `<colgroup>` | element defines a group of columns within a table. |
| `<col>` | element defines a column within a table and is used for defining common semantics on all common cells. It is generally found within a `<colgroup>` element. |
| `<tfoot>` | element defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table. |
| `<thead>` | element defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table. |
